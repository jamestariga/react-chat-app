# React Chat App

## About

This project is part of my 7 Days 7 React Project challenge. In this project, I used chatengine.io to create a live chat as well as Firebase to authenticate user logins. Users can then login to the chat app using their Google or Facebook account. Upon completing the authentication process, user can then make their chat room where they can invite people to join. Check out the live [site](https://chatrr-jamestariga.netlify.app).

## Run the application locally

Ensure that Node and npm is installed in your device. Make an account with [chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io/) to generate a chat ID. You will also need to set up a Firebase account where you will create a new project.
